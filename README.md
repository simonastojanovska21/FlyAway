# FlyAway

### Project made for my graduation thesis. 

FlyAway is a web application for a travel agency. It enables users to view and select the offers for the upcoming trips offered by the agency. The user can filter the trips by the destination, start and end date. After viewing the offer he can make reservation and payment for the trip. Administrator can add destinations, hotels, and trips for the travel agency, whereas an employee is able to cancel a reservation for a user trip. 

Additionally the web application offeres the users a list of destionations. For each destination the user can view short description, list of tourist attractions, information about the weather conditions and trips planned for the destination.

The data in the web application is enriched with Schema.org anotations. I have used informations from datasets from the Linked Open Data Cloud. All of these enable SEO and RichSnippets. 

On the following link you can view a demo of the FlyAway travel agency.
